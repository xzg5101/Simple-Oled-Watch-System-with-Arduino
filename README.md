# Simple-Oled-Watch-System-with-Arduino-IIC

With the help of U8g2 and RTC lib, this program enable a watch system with three major part: an Arduino controller, an 128X128 Oled screen (control chip SSD1327), and an RTC module (either a traditional DS3231 or a DS3231 for Pi). It has the ability to run precisely when the controller is power off.
